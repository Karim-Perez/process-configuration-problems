(integer scalar) # of products types (T)
(integer scalar) # of maximum cutting patterns (P)
(float scalar) cost of a single stroke of the cutting machine
(float scalar) cost of setup (changing the pattern)
(float scalar) length of the cutting machine (mm)
(float row array of size T) length of each product type (mm)
(integer row array of size T) demand of each product type (mm)

For the Knife-dependent cutting stock variant, the additional setup cost is 0.5 per knife used in each pattern.
